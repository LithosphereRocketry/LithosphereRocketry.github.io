<blockquote>
<p>adjective. crom&#183;&#8203;u&#183;&#8203;lent &#712;kr&#228;-my&#601;-l&#601;nt. informal + humorous. : acceptable, satisfactory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>from Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary</em></p>
<p>The following is a set of goals that one can aspire to in building a homebrew
computer system, whether it be a clone of an existing design, a new design built
around off-the-shelf core components, or an entirely homemade architecure. The
aim of this listing is to provide a set of basic functions to aspire to such
that, if all are implemented, your computer might be useful to someone who
actually wants to use a computer.</p>
<h1 id="goals">Goals</h1>
<ol>
<li>Display information to a user in human-readable format, whether on a screen,
  nixie tubes, serial terminal, or paper print-out.</li>
<li>Take input from the user in some vaguely usable way such as a keyboard.</li>
<li>Compute some piece of analysis that would be difficult, tedious, or
  otherwise impractical to do by hand.</li>
<li>Load and store data from a preexisting, non-hardware-specific source in a way
  that other contemporary or preexisting devices can understand.</li>
<li>Load, modify, and save a text document to persistent digital storage.</li>
<li>Write and run a program in a high-level, non-assembly language.</li>
<li>Play a game or otherwise provide entertainment capable of holding a user's
  attention for more than a few minutes.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="example-atari-800">Example: Atari 800</h1>
<p>Let's see how a classic system fulfils these requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Information is displayed via RF modulator to a conventional TV.</li>
<li>Input is taken via keyboard, joystick, or a few other specialty peripherals.</li>
<li>Rendering the Mandelbrot set is a popular example among hobbyists.</li>
<li>Data can be received and sent from contemporary computers via the optional
   300-baud modem expansion.</li>
<li>Numerous text editing programs existed, such as Panther and the Atari BASIC
   editor. Files can be loaded and saved on tape and floppy disk.</li>
<li>BASIC was natively supported, and third-party programs allowed a variety of
   other languages such as LISP.</li>
<li>Many games were released for the system; I myself am partial to Dig Dug.*</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>* I am partial to it mainly because for a while I used an Atari with a broken
     start button, and Dig Dug allows the game to start by pressing the joystick
     button instead.</p>
