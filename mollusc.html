<p>Because I didn't have enough homebrew computing projects already with NANDy, I
decided I might as well start another one. A while ago, I took a class on 
operating systems, where the final project was to add a feature to the
<a href="https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-riscv">XV6 kernel</a>, a minimal command-line Unix
designed to be tinkered with. Unfortunately, due to my overpacked schedule and
poor relationship with sleep at the time, I didn't really absorb that much of
the material. Now, I've decided to revisit it, in my own particular, uhhh...</p>

<p>This means that I'm doing everything basically from scratch, in as stubborn a
way as possible, making most of my decisions based on what I think would be fun
rather than any particular good design practice.</p>
<h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
<p>This page is not about the operating system itself. Instead, this is about the
CPU that will run this operating system. Because, of course, I couldn't just get
one of the <a href="https://riscv.org/">nice, free, easy-to-use CPU designs</a> that
already have solid toolchains and just write an OS for it. That would be boring.</p>
<p>This architecture needs to do a couple of things:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Be relatively easy to understand</strong> If I, the one making the architecture,
  don't know what's going on, the whole project basically falls apart.</li>
<li><strong>Be nice to write assembly code for.</strong> My <a href="nandy.html">other CPU project</a>
  has convinced me that general-purpose registers, big memory spaces, and
  especially non-tiny stack space are basic necessities when creating something
  I actually want to use for complex tasks.</li>
<li>Related, <strong>be nice to write compilers for.</strong> While smaller projects are fine
  for assembly, writing a whole memory-managed OS is going to be a lot easier
  if I can do the bulk of the work in C. Unusual, cramped, or otherwise weird
  architectures tend to be torturous to compile for, and I am not a compiler
  expert, so keeping it "normal" is going to be the name of the game here.</li>
<li><strong>Interface with common components.</strong> Even as much as I love writing things
  from scratch, there is going to be a point where I get really, really sick of
  designing interface logic.</li>
