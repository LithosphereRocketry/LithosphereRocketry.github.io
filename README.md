# LithosphereRocketry.github.io

Github Pages hosting repository for my personal website.

Only a few parts of the website are actually managed from this repository,
namely media files and basic CSS styling. Most of the work is done by the source
repository, which you can find
[here](https://github.com/LithosphereRocketry/LithosphereRocketrySiteSource).
