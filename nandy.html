            <h1 id="nandy">NANDy</h1>
<p>Some time ago, I was idly playing around with digital logic and remembered
something that seemed to be part of every piece of computer-engineering
educational material: you can make any logical device out of NAND gates.
(As an aside, NOR gates can do the same thing; I don't know why they don't get
talked about as much. Heck, a computer made entirely out of NOR gates landed us
on the moon.)</p>
<p>I decided to take a look at what it would take to implement an entire basic CPU
using only standard off-the-shelf NAND gates. It turns out, this is a very bad
idea.</p>
<p>Before we get too far into the weeds, I set some general ground rules and goals
for this project:</p>
<ul>
<li>The CPU itself will be entirely NAND gates. That's kind of the whole point
  of the project.</li>
<li>Any part which is strictly a NAND gate is permitted. This includes gates with
  any number of input pins as well as open-collector and other gate types.
  Schmitt-trigger gates are an interesting gray area, since they technically
  contain memory elements and therefore could be considered not just gates, but
  I don't plan to use any anyway, so it doesn't really matter.</li>
<li>Parts that are not the CPU are not restricted to NAND gates. I briefly
  considered building RAM and ROM out of gates, but it gets extremely tedious
  extremely quickly for any useful amount of storage. Additionally, clock
  generators and other support components can be built however I like. However,
  I won't push this limit; integrated memory chips will be used only for things
  that are fundamentally memory, and not dubious cases like microcode ROMs.</li>
<li>Peripheral devices don't have to be NAND gates, but it's more fun if they are.
  My general game plan is to implement these parts on an FPGA and then transfer
  them to dedicated ICs if they're simple enough.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
<p>Our building block for the project, for the most part, is going to be this:</p>
<p><img alt="Integrated circuit marked with code 74AC00P" src="media/nandy/7400.jpg"></p>
<p>This is about the most standard NAND gate you can get. It's a 4-module, 2-input
CMOS gate compatible with 5V logic levels; the AC in the part number indicates
that it's fairly fast, and most importantly it is very inexpensive in decent
quantities.</p>
<p>As the theorem states, we can build any combinational logic we want out of
these. Here's an XOR gate and a 1-bit full adder:</p>
<p><img alt="Schematic of XOR gate and full adder implemented using NAND gates, with
equivalent symbols alongside them" src="media/nandy/combinational.png"></p>
<p>Building elements that have memory is a bit trickier, and a bit less elegant.
Because memory elements tend to depend on themselves, they don't lend themselves
well to concise mathematical representations, instead relying on timing and
implementation details. Latches - components that allow their contents to change
continuously whenever their clock signal is high - aren't too bad:</p>
<p><img alt="Schematic of D latch implemented using NAND gates" src="media/nandy/dlatch.png"></p>
<p>Flip-flops - elements that can instantaneously sample a signal on the rising or
falling edge of the clock - are a bit more difficult. While it's possible to
build a functioning CPU without these components, it's a bit more difficult;
generally, it requires a two-phase clock or other similar strategy. </p><a href="#">Back to Top</a>
