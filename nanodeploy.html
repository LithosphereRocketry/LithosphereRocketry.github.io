<p>This project represents one of the most thorough nerd snipes I've fallen victim
to in quite a while.</p>
<p><img alt='xkcd comic describing "nerd sniping"; in the comic, while crossing the road a physicist is shown a problem asking the resistance of an infinite grid of resistors. Distracted, they stop walking and are hit by a truck.' src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/nerd_sniping.png"></p>

<p>The catalyst for this project is a discussion in the r/Rocketry discord server,
where it was noted that it might be interesting to attempt to fly dual deploy -
a rocket design where a small drogue parachute is deployed at maximum altitude,
followed by a larger chute after the rocket has descended some distance - in an
extremely small rocket.</p>
<p><img alt="A normal-sized dual-deployment rocket under parachute, showing both chutes unfurled" src="https://www.apogeerockets.com/images/newsletter/Newsletter-626-Images/figure_04_hi-res.jpg"></p>
<p><em>Image credit Apogee Rockets; this rocket is 4 inches in diameter, a fairly</em>
<em>normal size for this technique</em></p>
<p>The main obstacle to this (other than its lack of any kind of practical use) is
the size of altimeters. Most commercial deployment altimeters are designed for
tubes in the 1.25 - 1.5" diameter range, which is where dual deployment starts
to make actual sense as a way to reduce recovery area. At the time of writing,
the just-released Featherweight Blue Jay is one of the smaller dual-deployment
altimeters, and while it claims to fit in as small as 3/4" tube, actually wiring
it for deployment at that scale is extremely difficult.</p>
<p>This project throws all caution to the winds, and attempts to fit a full
dual-deployment altimeter in a 1/2" tube. This will come with many pitfalls and
compromises, but it is for the noblest possible goal: <em>commitment to the bit.</em></p>
<h2 id="assembly-concerns">Assembly concerns</h2>
<p>1/2" tube is really, really small. Usually, I try to use hand-solderable
components for as much as I can, but that's not an option here; everything here
will be size-constrained without much room for slack. For this reason, this
project will be designed around professional pick-and-place assembly, in this
case from JLCPCB. This brings up a significant obstacle - the JLC parts library.</p>
<p>As someone used to the relatively well-structured parts catalog of Digikey,
JLC's is... a little frustrating. For example, let's say I wanted to spec an LED
for my board. That might be in one of the following categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Optocoupler/LED/Digital Tube/Photoelectric Device &gt; Light Emitting Diodes (LED)</li>
<li>Optocouplers &amp; LEDs &amp; Infrared &gt; Light Emitting Diodes (LED)</li>
<li>Optoelectronics &gt; Light Emitting Diodes (LED)</li>
<li>Optoelectronics &gt; LED Indictaion - Discrete</li>
<li>Photoelectric Devices &gt; Light Emitting Diodes (LED)</li>
<li>LED/Photoelectric Devices &gt; Light Emitting Diodes (LED)</li>
</ul>
<p>Inevitably, for any given component, one category is "correct" and contains most
of the components you want; the others typically contain 50-100 products that
are of the same type, just with worse selection. (In this case, the correct
category is the fourth one above.)</p>
<p>Anyway, JLC, pls fix. Soapbox over. Let's build a flight computer.</p>
<h2 id="core-components">Core components</h2>
<p>The first thing we have to decide is what the core parts of our design are. We
have to pick approximately four main parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Processor</li>
<li>Sensors</li>
<li>Pyrotechnic outputs</li>
<li>Data storage</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="processor">Processor</h3>
<p>For the processor, I wanted something that fit in a 4x4mm QFN package. This is
about as small as you can get before getting to bare-silicon packages like
WLCSP, which even for an automated-assembly project is pretty scary. After
scrolling through JLC's parts library for a bit, I decided on the MSP430G2452
from Texas Instruments. This is a pretty limited microcontroller compared to
modern ARM chips, but it has a couple advantages that matter here:</p>
<ul>
<li>TI's debugging tools are quite good, and I like how their hardware registers
  are set up</li>
<li>At only 16 pins, the pin density is not insane by tiny-QFN standards, so if
  I do need to poke an oscilloscope in there to debug something it's not totally
  infeasible</li>
<li>It has a configurable internal oscillator that can be run at up to 16MHz, so
  I don't need to include an external crystal</li>
<li>It has a generous 8KB of flash, which should be plenty for the relatively
  simple programs I'll be writing</li>
</ul>
<p>However, it also has a couple key disadvantages that I'll have to work around:</p>
<ul>
<li>It only has 256 <em>bytes</em> of RAM. Yowch.</li>
<li>It only has one timer peripheral. This means I can't, for example, use one
  timer to generate the tone for the buzzer and another to time the flight
  control loop.</li>
<li>It only has 10 digital I/O pins, even after we repurpose the pins used for the
  crystal normally. This means we may have to get creative in how we attach
  things.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="sensors">Sensors</h3>
<p>To get reliable parachute deployment without doing oodles of math, the main
piece of data you need is air pressure. As the rocket ascends, the air pressure
around it decreases in a fairly predictable way; we can predict our altitude
within a fairly tight margin just by measuring the pressure and temperature
outside and punching them into a big formula provided to us by the NOAA. This is
how real aircraft determine their altitude, and luckily for us there's a slew
of fairly inexpensive sensors that do this very well.</p>
<p>The sensor I ended up with was the GZP6816D from Sencoch Semiconductor, a
decision mainly driven by price. There's not much English documentation, but I
was able to machine-translate enough that it should't be too difficult to figure
out the necessary commands. It also has the convenience that it hasn't (yet)
been removed from JLCPCB's budget assembly service like most other barometers
have, knocking a good $20 off my prototyping cost.</p>
<h3 id="pyrotechnics">Pyrotechnics</h3>
<p>This is another place where my job was not too difficult. For the pyrotechnics
I'm using (MJG e-matches) I need to be able to switch around 1-3 amps at battery
voltage, and there are plenty of options that match these specs. I settled on
the HL2302 as it's easily available on JLC's assembly library, but almost
anything would work here. I considered the slightly more powerful HL2312 here,
but the higher performance is actually a little worse here, for reasons I'll
discuss in a second.</p>
<p>The other half of the pyrotechnic circuit is continuity and current sensing. For
this I used a circuit that is either kinda clever or extremely overthought:</p>
<p><img alt="A circuit diagram of the pyrotechnic circuit, showing MOSFET with 47K resistor in parallel, and 47K resistor to microcontroller pin" src="media/nanodeploy/pyro.png"></p>
<p>The idea here is that I can use the same pin as both my continuity check and
current sensing. If the MOSFET is switched off, then the resistor to ground acts
as a simple pull-down: if an igniter is connected, the continuity pin will be
pulled high, otherwise it will be pulled low. (The 47K resistor in series helps
make sure that the difference between battery voltage and microcontroller
voltage doesn't fry the input-clamp diodes. TI rates this at 2 mA, while I
shouldn't be exceeding 50 uA.)</p>
<p>When the MOSFET is switched on, the low-resistance path to ground completely
overwhelms all other effects in the circuit, and the igniter fires. At this
point, it's useful to measure the current passing through the igniter, which is
where our lower-spec MOSFETs come in. At 3.3V gate-drive voltage, our MOSFETs
should have a resistance of around 50 milliohms, and we can use this as a very
crude shunt resistor to determine how much current our igniter is drawing. Quick
math tells us that with 1023 divisions between 0 and 3.3 volts, our analog pins
should read one "tick" per 3 millivolts across the MOSFET, or 65 milliamps drawn
by the igniter. At our nominal firing current of 1 amp, that gives us around 4
bits of precision in our current measurements - plenty to help diagnose any
issues.</p>
<h3 id="storage">Storage</h3>
<p>Compared to the needlessly complicated mess of the pyrotechnic circuits, the
storage is practically a turn-key solution. Because of the shortage of pins on
the processor, I need the storage to share the I2C bus with the barometer rather
than requiring its own. Traditionally, NOR flash would be the medium of choice
here, but there don't seem to be many options for it that don't require an SPI
bus. Luckily, the actual data we have to log can be made pretty small, so just
a standard 24C-series EEPROM will have plenty of space and write bandwidth, and
these days EEPROM write endurance seems to be high enough that we can avoid
worrying too much about data loss. I ended up deciding on a 24C128 with 16KB of
storage - if we can keep the data frame at 8 bytes, this gives us around 3.5
minutes of runtime at 10 samples per second, and we can always vary our sample
rate to squeeze a bit more life out of it.</p>
<h2 id="interfacing">Interfacing</h2>
<p>An important question in this design is how we get data on and off of the flight
computer. For programming, we really want to have access to the two-wire debug
interface, which looks a lot like SWD but isn't quite (I think), so those get
broken out to a header. Conveniently, one of them is also the reset pin, so we
can force-reset the MCU if necessary with judicious use of a piece of wire.</p>
<p>User-side interfacing - for configuring the flight parameters and downloading
data - is a bit trickier. Originally, I was planning to use the I2C bus as well,
by making a dock portion that would present as an I2C device to the processor
and allow data to be copied to a computer. However, when I laid this out on the
PCB, it turned out that the width of the connector was a major limiting factor
in the size of the board. To reach the logical extreme of this project, I wanted
to use as few wires to communicate with the computer as possible. So what's the
fewest wires you can use? One, of course!</p>
<p>From Wikipedia:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1-Wire is a wired half-duplex serial bus designed by Dallas Semiconductor that
provides low-speed (16.3 kbit/s) data communication and supply voltage over
a single conductor.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1-Wire</em></p>
<p>1-Wire was developed as a protocol for Dallas Semiconductor's iButton project,
a product that allowed you to make tiny, low-power devices to be used similarly
to NFC smart cards. The idea was you could have an iButton ID chip, thermometer,
humidity sensor, timer, or what have you that could be thrown in with a shipment
of sensitive material to physically verify that it was shipped correctly. For
example, if you had a shipment that had to be delivered within 3 days, you could
include a timer button and demand a refund from your parcel carrier if the timer
read more than 3 days when you opened the package.</p>
<p>In my case, it's useful mostly for the titular feature of requiring only one
connection - rather than separate data and clock signals, data is transferred by
long and short low pulses on the data line. This saves one pin on my debug
connector, which lets me reduce the length of the board by 1.25 millimeters.
A small victory, but a victory nonetheless. In theory, I could also attempt to
power the board parasitically via the data line, as was intended by the original
standard, but there's no real need for that here - it's just as easy to plumb
the 5V power coming from the computer into the battery input and let the system
operate as normal.</p>
<p>The main disadvantage of OneWire here (other than its incredibly slow speed) is
that the MSP430 doesn't provide any hardware utilities for it as it does for
more common protocols like UART and SPI. Therefore, we have to implement the
entire protocol by bit-banging, using the processor's pin and timer interrupts
to keep track of what is going on... except as mentioned, we only have one timer
available. In the end, I ended up using every single available timer interrupt.</p>
<p>First, a rough outline of what the OneWire protocol looks like. OneWire  is a
single-wire, open-collector bus, so the only thing any device can do to
communicate is pull the bus low. Hosts start by pulling the bus low for a very
long reset pulse, after which devices respond by pulling the bus low for a short
presence pulse to notify the host that there is something on the bus. After the
reset is completed, the device and host communicate by issuing shorter low
pulses for 1s and longer pulses for 0s. At any time, the host may issue another
extra-long pulse to reset all devices and start from the beginning.</p>
<p>In flight mode, everything is handled by the TACCR0 interrupt, which is the only
one capable of automatically resetting the timer and the only one that has its
own dedicated interrupt routine. This runs at 8KHz to allow it to produce up to 
a 4KHz tone out of the speaker, and wakes the processor every 200 cycles or 25
milliseconds to record data from the sensors.</p>
<p>As soon as activity is detected on the OneWire bus, the TACCR0 interrupt is
switched off and the other TimerA interrupts - which share a single ISR - are
switched on. The timer is initially paused, and is started at every falling edge
of the OneWire pin. The timer's overflow interrupt is configured to reset the
timer counter to 0 and pause it; this makes it work as a quasi-one-shot.</p>
<p>The TACCR2 channel is used exclusively to detect the reset pulse. It is set to
just under the 480us pulse length for reset, and if this threshold is reached
before the bus goes high, the bus reenters the reset state.</p>
<p>This leaves only the TACCR1 channel to handle all of the OneWire business logic.
Luckily, the fact that the timer is consistently synced to the falling edge
makes this pretty feasible: most timings in OneWire can be defined relative to
the falling edge, so events such as reads and writes can be "scheduled" to
happen as needed just by setting the TACCR1 value. The only case where this
doesn't work is for generating the presence pulse, as it's located relative to
the end of the reset pulse rather than the beginning; however, this can be
worked around by simply setting the TACCR1 time to the current time plus an
offset whenever the reset pulse ends.</p><a href="#">Back to Top</a>
